The examples in this repository are from the book by Al Sweigart, 2020, "AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF WITH PYTHON - PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING FOR TOTAL BEGINNERS", 2nd Ed., no starch press  

The examples have been modified slightly to be used specifically with VS Code only without the need for terminal or QT console use.
