There are many editors that can be used to run python code. I like to keep it as simple as possible and maintain a single program interface for all of my program entry
and debugging. My choice for editor/code runner is Visual Studio Code. It can be downloaded from the Visual Studio Code web site. [link]{https://code.visualstudio.com/}.

Once downloaded I would suggest opening VS Code and installing the python extensions needed to run the examples. You will need Python, Pylance, Jupyter, Code Runner,and
python-inline-repl. These extensions will allow use to do all of the exercises in the books listed within this repository.
